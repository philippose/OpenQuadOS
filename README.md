OpenQuadOS
==========

Yet another generic Software Framework aimed at the ever world of QuadCopters

However, the goal is to gain experience in the creation of reusable 
Software for Embedded applications. Of special interest is the Hardware 
Abstraction Layer (HAL) which ideally creates a water-tight interface 
between the Application Software and the Bare-Metal Embedded Hardware.

This Software is at the initial phases of its evolution, and any ideas, 
pointers, and help will be much appreciated. 

The current implementation of the HAL is greatly influenced by the 
STM32F3Discovery Platform.
